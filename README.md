## Exploratory Testing

After some initial exploratory testing, we were able to confirm the error handling messages were present and that the basic functionalities of the program were working as expected. However an issue was discovered when using MacOs and moving files within the project directory. Please refer to [THIS BUG](https://github.com/romaingrude/Extending_fake_data_challenge/issues/1).
